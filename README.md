# OrigenLink

Plug-in for Origen to enable live silicon debug from Origen source

Included are source files for the Plug-in:
  callback_handlers.rb
    methods to initialize and finalize automatically when a pattern is run
  capture_support.rb
    implements capture of vector data when requested, moves actual DUT response into the origen environment
  configuration_commands.rb
    methods for defining pin map, pin order, timing
  server_com.rb
    methods for interfacing with the server side app
  vector_based.rb
    implements the main methods for intercepting vector data from origen and running them
  
Also included are the server side source files intended to run on a [Udoo Neo](http://www.udoo.org/docs-neo/Introduction/Introduction.html) or similar IoT device.  The server is responsible for driving and reading IO's:
  pin.rb
    pin class for interacting with 
  sequencer.rb
    the brains behind the server app
  start_link_server
    located in the bin directory, serves a 2 way TCP interface between the app side plug-in and the server side sequencer
