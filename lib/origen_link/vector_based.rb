  # OrigenLink::VectorBased
  #   This class is meant to be used for live silicon debug.  Vector data that Origen
  #   generates is intercepted and sent to a debug device (typically will be a Udoo
  #   Neo - www.udoo.org).  The debug device can be any device that is able to serve
  #   a TCP socket, recieve and interpret the command set used by this class and send
  #   the expected responses.

  #		tester.pinorder = 'tclk,tms,tdi,tdo'
